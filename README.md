🏄️ Gamified Data Labeling: Climb Towards the Summit!

🎯 Revolutionizing Data Labeling for AI

Traditional data labeling is slow, costly, and often unethical. Our project transforms this process into an engaging, fair, and rewarding experience through gamification. Instead of relying on underpaid labor, we empower users to label data while enjoying interactive challenges.

🚀 Features

🕹️ Four Game Modes

Data Classification – Label images into categories

Data Segmentation – Annotate objects within images

Classification vs AI – Race against an AI model in labeling accuracy

Segmentation vs AI – Compete with an AI in segmentation tasks

🌟 Gamified Experience

Beautiful UI with smooth animations

Profile Page to track progress

Mountain Climbing Animation – Earn points and climb towards the summit!
